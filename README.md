# Landing Page Project
PROJECT SPECIFICATION

# Interface and Architecture


## Usability 
1.  All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]
2.  A Responsive layout of the landing page should be created to use across all devices [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]
3.  Make sure that the navigation bar is responsive too across all these devices [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]
4.  Responsiveness can be verified by inspecting the landing page using the Developer Tools option on Google Chrome Browser [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]

## Styling
1. Styling should be added for active states [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]
2. Set CSS class active state when the element is in the viewport [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]
3. The active section in the Navbar should be highlighted [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]

## HTML Structure
1. There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>]


# Landing Page Behavior

## Navigation
1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML [ <font color='green'> <b>DONE </b></font>] 

## Section Active State

1. It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page [ <font color='red'> <b>Running </b></font>]

2. Tip: Detect the element location relative to the viewport using .getBoundingClientRect() built-in function.

## Scroll to Anchor
###When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
You can use the following methods to fulfill this criterion:
1. Use addEventListener('click',....) to listen to the click event.
2. Use preventDefault() as if there is a default event occurring we need to stop that.
3. There are several javascript methods for scrolling, scroll(), scrollBy(), and scrollIntoView() are all acceptable.
4. A smooth scrolling behavior is expected in the project.
